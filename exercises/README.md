# Discussion of various exercises

## Eva López MaxHangs strength training protocol 
+ Always warm up properly before doing the MaxHangs hangboard routine.
+ Perform three to four sets with increasing added weight or decreasing edge depth (50 – 90% of the previous session’s load).
+ The number of MaxHangs sets can be varied between 2 – 5. (Beginners should start with two sets.)
+ The hang time can be varied between 5 – 15 seconds. (Typical hang time: 10 seconds.)
+ The margin is also called the effort level (EL)  and may be varied between 1 – 5 seconds. Leaving a margin leads to similar results as reaching failure, but reduces the risk of injury. (Typical margin: 3 seconds.)
+ The rest time between sets can be varied between 3 – 5 minutes. (Typical rest time between sets: 3 minutes.)

### Margin

### Eva López MaxHangs hangboard routine details (MED)
+ Choose an edge on which you can hang for only 6 – 20 seconds.
+ Hang for 5 – 15 seconds (leave a 1 – 5-second margin), rest for 3 – 5 minutes.
+ Complete 2 – 5 sets.
+ For the MaxHangs MED protocol, an edge between 5 – 10 mm is usually chosen. 
+ During each set try to assess the time margin you have left on the hangs. 
  + If you feel like your margin exceeds 3 – 5 seconds, decrease the edge depth by 1 – 2 mm, according to the perceived effort.
  + If you feel like your margin approaches zero, increase the edge depth by 1 – 2 mm, according to the perceived effort.


### Eva López MaxHangs hangboard routine details (MAW)
+ Choose a grip position to train.
+ Add enough weight to be able to hang for only 6 – 20 seconds.
+ Hang for 5 – 15 seconds (leave a 1 – 5-second margin), rest for 3 – 5 minutes.
+ Complete 2 – 5 sets.
+ For the MaxHangs MAW protocol, an edge between 8 – 22 mm is usually chosen, but you can do it for any hold. (Typical added load: 5 – 55 kg.)
+ During each set try to assess the time margin you have left on the hang.
  + If you feel like your margin exceeds 3 seconds, add 2 – 5 kg for the next set, depending on bodyweight.
  + If you feel like your margin approaches zero, subtract 2 – 5 kg for the next set, depending on bodyweight.


## The “7-53” fingerboard protocol details - Eric Hörst
+ Choose two to five different grip positions. Consider including:
  + Half crimps
  + Full crimps
  + Three-finger pockets
  + Two-finger pockets: index-middle (IM), middle-ring (MR) and ring-pinkie (RP) – advanced
  + Deep monos
+ For each grip position determine the amount of added or subtracted weight, allowing you to hang for 10 seconds.
+ For each grip position:
  + Hang for 7 seconds, rest for 53 seconds.
  + Complete a total of 3 hangs per set.
  + Rest 3 – 5 minutes and switch to the next grip position.
  + Complete a total of 2 – 5 sets.
