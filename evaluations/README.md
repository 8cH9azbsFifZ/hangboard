## Evaluations of the measured data

From the MVC we can estimate the maximal boulder grade according to [[[MVC1]]] using 
the script in `evaluations/estimate_bouldergrade_from_mvc.py`.

Here are some first test measurement data sets. The test has been conducted with a hang, one handed pulls, a fast and a slow pullup.
The data and evaluation scripts can be found in the directory `evaluations`.
