# Dimensions for mounting bracket load cells

# Variants for mounting the board with different load cells

+ Zlagboard uses the same M6 screw as the load sensors. Therefore it can easily be mounted on the two load cells.

Lessons learned (Why not recommended):
+ The load scale sensors must be used with a custom made mounting bracket
+ The slightest torsions or tilting leads to weight errors of up to 20%.
