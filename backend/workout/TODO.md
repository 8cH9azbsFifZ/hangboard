# Bugs
+ Only look for two holds using distance, if not two were already given(!)
+ False detections lead to start of exercises.

# Features
+ Initial weight detection for intensity calculations (must be started using event)
+ If "spacers" for reduced hold size are implemented - add this as a feature
